## Example

```javascript
// Without this plugin...
import SomeExample from '../../../some/example.js';
const OtherExample = require('../../../other/example.js');
import('../../../other/dynamic').then(mod => {
  // ...
});

// With babel-plugin-root-import you can write...
import SomeExample from '~/some/example.js';
const OtherExample = require('~/other/example.js');
import('~/other/dynamic').then(mod => {
  // ...
});
```

## Install

Install with your package manager of choice.

```
npm install babel-plugin-root-import --save-dev
# or
yarn add babel-plugin-root-import --dev
```

## Use

Add it to your plugins array in your babel config, e.g.
a `.babelrc` file.

```javascript
{
  "plugins": [
    ["babel-plugin-root-import"]
  ]
}
```

For recent react-native versions, add it as a plugin in `babel.config.js`:

```js
module.exports = (api) => {
  api.cache(true);

  return {
    plugins: [
      'babel-plugin-root-import',
    ],
  };
}
```

For the rest of this readme, it's implied that you'll configure the plugin as above when using react-native.

## Config

You can configure this plugin by changing the string plugin
name to a two-item array. Note that this array is nested inside
the plugins array. Here's an example with the default config.

```javascript
  "plugins": [
    [
      "babel-plugin-root-import",
      {
        "rootPathSuffix": "./",
        "rootPathPrefix": "~/"
      }
    ]
  ],
```

Multiple rules may be specified by creating an object with `{ "paths": [firstItem, secondItem] }`, e.g.

```javascript
  "plugins": [
    [
      "babel-plugin-root-import",
      {
        "paths": [
          {
            "rootPathSuffix": "./src/components",
            "rootPathPrefix": "~/"
          },
          {
            "rootPathSuffix": "./src/utils",
            "rootPathPrefix": "!/"
          },
        ]
      }
    ]
  ],
```


### Custom rootPathSuffix

By default, the import will be relative to the working directory of
the process running babel. Typically this means you'll have import
paths like `~/src/foo.js`. You can change the prefix of `"./"` to e.g.
`"src"` or `"src/js"` with this config option.

```javascript
{
  "plugins": [
    ["babel-plugin-root-import", {
      "rootPathSuffix": "src/js"
    }]
  ]
}
```

The paths `"src/js"` and `"./src/js"` behave the same.

### Custom rootPathPrefix

If you don't like the `~` syntax you can use your own symbol (for example an `#` symbol or `\` or anything you want). Using
`@` is not recommended, as recent versions of NPM allow `@` in package names. `~` is the default since
it's very unlikely to conflict with anything (and wouldn't be expanded to HOME anyway).

```javascript
//
// Waiting this change: https://github.com/entwicklerstube/babel-plugin-root-import/pull/97
{
  "plugins": [
    ["babel-plugin-root-import", {
      "rootPathPrefix": "#/"
    }]
  ]
}

// Now you can use the plugin like either of these
import foo from '#my-file';
import foo from '#/my-file';
```

If you set it to e.g. `"#/"` then it'll require the slash in the import path.

### Multiple custom prefixes and suffixes

You can supply an array of the above. The plugin will try each prefix/suffix pair in the order they are defined.

```javascript
{
  "plugins": [
    ["babel-plugin-root-import", [{
        // `~` is the default so you can remove this if you want
        "rootPathPrefix": "~/",
        "rootPathSuffix": "src/js"
      }, {
        "rootPathPrefix": "@/",
        "rootPathSuffix": "other-src/js"
      }, {
        // since we suport relative paths you can also go into a parent directory
        "rootPathPrefix": "#/",
        "rootPathSuffix": "../../src/in/parent"
      }]
    ]
  ]
}

// Now you can use the plugin like:
import foo from '~/foo';
const bar = require('@/bar');
```

### Don't let ESLint be confused

If you use [eslint-plugin-import](https://github.com/benmosher/eslint-plugin-import) to validate imports it may be necessary to instruct ESLint to parse root imports. You can use [eslint-import-resolver-root-import](https://github.com/diego3g/eslint-import-resolver-root-import).

```json
"import/resolver": {
  "root-import": {}
}
```

### Don't let Flow be confused

If you use Facebook's [Flow](https://flowtype.org/) for type-checking it is necessary to instruct it on how to map your chosen prefix to the root directory. Add the following to your `.flowconfig` file, replacing `{rootPathPrefix}` with your chosen prefix (minus a trailing slash if any) and `{rootPathSuffix}`Â with your chosen suffix.
```
[options]
module.name_mapper='^{rootPathPrefix}/\(.*\)$' -> '<PROJECT_ROOT>/{rootPathSuffix}/\1'
```

### Don't let VSCode be confused

For features like go-to-definition, VSCode needs to be able to resolve `require`/`import` paths to files on disk. This only works with one `rootPathSuffix`, but you may define multiple `rootPathPrefix` entries.

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "{rootPathPrefix}/*": ["src/*"]
    }
  }
}
```

For example, with `~/x/y.js` -> `./src/x/y.js`:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "~/*": ["src/*"]
    }
  }
}
```

## FYI

Webpack delivers a similar feature, if you just want to prevent end-less import strings you can also define `aliases` in the `resolve` module, at the moment it doesn't support custom/different symbols and multiple/custom suffixes.

### Want to revert back to relative paths?

Sometimes tooling might not be up to scratch, meaning you lose features such as navigation in your IDE. In such cases you might want to revert back to using relative paths again. If you have a significant amount of files, it might be worth looking into [tooling](https://www.npmjs.com/package/convert-root-import) to help you with the conversion.
